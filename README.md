[!as](https://github.com/sakib4535/API_Threat_Detection/blob/main/as.webp)

## **Project Overview**

This project addresses the critical challenge of detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), a sophisticated and stealthy form of cyberattack. APTs aim to infiltrate and remain undetected within systems over extended periods, leveraging advanced techniques to evade conventional security measures. By employing machine learning methodologies, this framework uncovers anomalies and suspicious behaviors indicative of APT activities. The project synthesizes feature engineering, robust preprocessing, algorithmic design, and detailed evaluation metrics to create a resilient detection system.

## **Research Context and Significance**

**Literature Review**
The rise of APTs has been extensively documented in cybersecurity literature. Traditional detection mechanisms, such as signature-based methods, often fail to identify novel and evolving APT tactics due to their reliance on pre-existing threat patterns. Recent research emphasizes the importance of behavioral analysis and anomaly detection in overcoming these limitations. Machine learning models have shown promise in this regard, providing:

- **Adaptability:** Models can generalize to detect unseen attack patterns.
- **Efficiency:** Automated analysis of large-scale network traffic data.
- **Precision:** Reduction in false positives, a critical requirement in cybersecurity.
Key studies highlight the role of features such as session durations, packet inter-arrival times, and TCP handshake anomalies in detecting sophisticated attacks. This project builds on these findings, offering a comprehensive and practical implementation.

## **Hypothesis**
**Feature Relevance Hypothesis:** Temporal, packet-level, transaction-level, and behavioral features significantly improve the detection accuracy of APTs.
**Algorithm Synergy Hypothesis:** Combining linear models (Logistic Regression) with non-linear models (Decision Trees) enhances the robustness and reliability of APT detection systems.
**Performance Benchmark Hypothesis:** The proposed model achieves superior detection metrics compared to traditional heuristic-based approaches.

## **Key Components**

**1. Feature Engineering and Preprocessing**
Feature engineering is pivotal in capturing nuanced network behaviors that differentiate malicious activities from normal traffic. Key features include:
###**Temporal Features:**
- **stime** (Session Time): Identifies anomalies in session durations, which may signal unauthorized activities.
- **sintpkt** & **dintpkt** (Inter-packet Times): Detects stealthy communication patterns typical of APTs.
- **Packet-Level Features:**
- **sttl & dttl**(Source/Destination TTL): Highlights mismatches in TTL values indicative of routing irregularities or reconnaissance attempts.
synack & ackdat: Exposes anomalies in the TCP handshake process, revealing potential session hijacking or scanning activities.

### **Transaction-Level Features:**
- **trans_depth:** Flags probing or deep scanning behaviors.
- **res_bdy_len:** Identifies unusual response payloads that could indicate data exfiltration attempts.

### **Behavioral Features:**
**tcprtt** (TCP Round Trip Time): High RTT values may suggest intermediary attack stages.
Encoded Categorical Features (proto, state, service): Encapsulates protocol-specific behavior to uncover suspicious patterns.
